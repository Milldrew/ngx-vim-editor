Update the app.controller.ts and the app.service.ts 


So that the nestjs application returns an array of data for a pie chart

The data should be in the following format:

[
  {
    "name": "Category A",
    "value": 40
  },
  {
    "name": "Category B",
    "value": 30
  },
  {
    "name": "Category C",
    "value": 20
  },
  {
    "name": "Category D",
    "value": 10
  }
]

the endpoint should be /api/pie-chart-data

also update the app.component.ts and app.component.html and app.component.scss 

to have a d3.js pie chart that retrieves the data from http://localhost:3000/api/pie-chart-data

and upon the arrival of the data the pie chart should be rendered

The d3.js pie chart should be drawn within a div within the app.component.html file
the div id should be pie-chart

and the pie chart should be responsive to the size of the div
meaning that the width and height of the pie chart should be equal to the width and height of the div
and the sizing of the svg elements inside of the svg element should resize accordingly
